# C++ Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the C++ Algorithms Repository! This repository serves as a collection of algorithms implemented in C++ programming language, covering various topics. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and exploring different algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques using C++.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes algorithms related to the following topics:

- Sorting and Searching
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- String Manipulation
- Mathematical Algorithms
- And more...

## Getting Started

To explore and use the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

https://github.com/ManoloBetancur/CppAlgorithms.git

2. Navigate to the specific algorithm or topic folder you are interested in.

3. Each algorithm is contained in its own separate file with a meaningful name. Open the desired algorithm file in a C++ compiler or editor of your choice.

4. Review the algorithm implementation, comments, and any instructions provided within the file.

5. Compile and run the algorithm in your C++ environment to see it in action.

6. Feel free to modify and experiment with the algorithms to suit your needs or to explore different variations.
